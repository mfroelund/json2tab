!!****  * windfarm parametrisation following Fitch et al. 2012 and Volker et al. 2015
!!
!!
!!
!!    PURPOSE
!!    -------
!!      The purpose of this routine is to define different windturbine types for
!!      windfarm parametrisation (thrust ct and power cp coefficients, radius of rotor PRADROT,
!!      cutin and out speed cp and ct is given as function of windspeed in 1m/s steps  
!!
!!
!!**  METHOD
!!    ------
!!    each turbine type has an individual code in the input file:
!!    first 3 digits: diameter of rotor, last two digits: manufacturer

!!    30 Haliade OFFSHORE
!!    31 REF OFFSHORE (KNMI)
!!    32 Adwen
!!    33 Areva
!!    34 BARD
!!
!!    If two types with same diameter and manufacturer exist, the diameter in the code can be slightly changed
!!    as the rotor radius used in the calculations PRADROT is attributed to the unique turbine type below separately
